# MVP DUE MAY 25th, 2025

### How to Start a dev build

## What is the point of this app?

The purpose of this app is to create a family nutritional app

Users should be able to create their family profiles then the app should configure how much food and what macros based on person to person healthinfo (should introudce micros later)

Should also be able to spit out recipes that dont include any allergens specified by the family memebers healthinfo and recipes that would help in completing macros for the day
also the recipes should be divied up by person to person so not a 5lb ham for 2 people or a slice of chicken for a family of 8

there should also be a community tab for sharing experiences and custom recipes and also really great deals etc. communal space type ish

### 3.8.25
## 1st foundational git
Using expo for deployment and testing, firebase for Oauth and dbing for now super simple want an mvp up and running
reactnative and expo serve the front and backend supp


### 3.16.25
## User Reg & Login
User registration and login working through firebase, need to connect the auth providers to pop up but may not be completely necessary for the MVP. Still need to find the proper way to connect our own running LLM and fine tune (hardest part) for specifically cooking, nutrition, family profiles, adding members. Next stop is to start the DB connecting to users.
